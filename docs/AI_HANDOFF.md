# AI HANDOFF — geekdadteach/mindcraft-ce (NewEarth fork)

**Snapshot:** 2026-10-24. Verify repository and live state before changing anything.

## 2026-10-24 — Receipts, rotation, and longer advice (merged-pending-deploy)
- Rebased onto `newearth/main` `4398d7a` (PR #10). Optional V2 JSONL receipts stay off unless `BOB_BRAIN_V2_EVENT_LOG` is set. `advice_injected` is written only after the stored line is found in the finished conversation prompt. Optional rotation stays off unless `BOB_BRAIN_V2_ROTATE_LOG=1` (four archives `.1`–`.4`, otherwise the 1 MiB stop). See `docs/BOB_BRAIN.md` and `docs/BOB_V2_RECEIPT_ROTATION.md`.
- Each stored note is capped at 900 characters (`BOB_BRAIN_MAX_ADVICE_CHARS`), cut at a sentence, line, or word, with `…`. The `$LONG_MEMORY` block is capped at 2500 characters (`BOB_BRAIN_MAX_ADVICE_BLOCK_CHARS`) and keeps the newest whole notes. The unverified framing is unchanged.
- **Not live.** Receipts, rotation, and the longer advice are merged-pending-deploy. Live Bob is still `4398d7a` (below). GitHub Actions workflows stay. Retiring them is draft PR #9 and is not part of this branch.

## Role of this repo
- Home of Bob's **game code** (Mindcraft CE + NewEarth changes). Public.
- The private repo `geekdadteach/minebob` holds ops (scripts, Discord control bot, reset-watcher, systemd units, polkit, Bob Brain queue source), config/profiles, docs, AI handoff rules, and the record of **which commit of this fork is live**.

## Branches
- `develop` — fork default branch, as inherited from upstream. Do not change it or the default-branch setting without Randy's OK.
- `newearth/live-2026-10-23` — exact live tree from LinuxGrok on 2026-10-23:
  - `80045e6` — exact live snapshot of `~/ai-player/mindcraft-ce-stable-42da10d` (upstream stable `42da10d` + working tree), unchanged.
  - `49761ee` — exact live `package-lock.json` + `NEWEARTH.md`.
  - Later commits on this branch are documentation only unless the changelog says otherwise.
- `newearth/main` — `5d8be33` (= `49761ee` code + docs), then PR #1 merged as `e923683`, then PR #2 merged as `dddbaf4`, then PR #3 merged as `b940ba3` (prismarine-chunk guard), then PR #4 merged as `caa179a` (Bob Brain client), then PR #5 merged as `bf99ace` (plain-text advice, conversation prompt only), then PR #10 merged as `4398d7a` (idempotent Bob Brain client keys).
- `cursor/bob-brain-advice-1dc4` — PR #5, merged into `newearth/main` as `bf99ace` and included in the live `4398d7a` tree. Readable review notes, public `enqueuePlan` / `enqueueFailureAnalysis` / `currentAdvice` / `status`, and advice only in prompts that contain `$LONG_MEMORY`. See `docs/BOB_BRAIN.md`.
- `cursor/bob-brain-client-key-391b` — PR #10, merged as `4398d7a` and deployed (see What is live). `client_key` names one request (kind, coarse label, canonical payload, 10-minute bucket) instead of a cell forever. A reused-key HTTP 400 is counted and not retried. Non-2xx responses log the JSON `error` string, clipped and deduped. See `docs/BOB_BRAIN.md`.
- `cursor/bob-v2-receipts-14bd` — PR #6, optional V2 JSONL receipts. Its code is in the rebased PR #8 branch. Merged-pending-deploy. Off unless `BOB_BRAIN_V2_EVENT_LOG` is set.
- `feature/v2-receipt-rotation-review-20261023` — PR #8, rebased onto `4398d7a`: PR #6 receipts, PR #7 bounded rotation, and longer advice. Merged-pending-deploy. Not on the live process.
- `newearth/secure-mindserver-2026-10-23` — PR #2, merged into `newearth/main` as `dddbaf4` (deployed 2026-10-23), from `5d8be33`: MindServer binds `MINDCRAFT_BIND_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`), optional token-gated BobBot control (off unless `MINDCRAFT_BOBBOT_TOKEN_FILE` is set), port comment fixed to 8081.
- `newearth/port-minebob-2026-10-23` — PR #1, merged into `newearth/main` as `e923683` (deployed as part of `dddbaf4`), from `5d8be33`: pathfinder door/gate patch from minebob `73f7378` (matches live `node_modules`), `full_state.js` goal block.

## What is live
- 2026-10-24 11:12 AM ET: Bob is running `newearth/main` `4398d7a` (PR #10, idempotent client keys) in LITE mode. The private ops repo records the deploy. Receipts, bounded rotation, and the longer advice caps are not in that process; they are merged-pending-deploy on PR #8.
- Previous live tree was `newearth/main` `dddbaf4`, deployed 2026-10-23. That “live is `dddbaf4`” note is stale.
- The prismarine-chunk guard from PR #3 (`b940ba3`) is in `4398d7a`. A checkout of this commit includes that patch file.
- Older rollback tree: `49761ee` content from 2026-10-23.
- Planned, not done: run Bob straight from a checkout of this fork so live == GitHub.

## Bob Brain client

- Game-side client only. The queue stays a separate process on `127.0.0.1:8765`. This client never runs commands from a job result. The queue is not modified by this fork.
- PR #4 (`caa179a`) is on `newearth/main`. A live queue test of that client put a truncated JSON dump in Bob's note. PR #5 (`bf99ace`) renders `summary`, or a plain plan / failure-analysis line, and skips `validation.valid === false`. That rendering is in the live `4398d7a` tree. PR #10 (`4398d7a`) is merged and deployed.
- `client_key` is unique on the queue forever. A second POST with the same key and a different kind or payload is HTTP 400 `client_key already used for different job`. The same key and payload returns the old job. Keys from PR #4 were only the cell and cause, the failure kind and cell, or the plan objective, so the next death or failure in that cell (a different exact position or goal) was a 400, and an identical payload only replayed a finished job. The client now hashes the kind, that coarse label, a canonical JSON of the payload, and a 10-minute bucket. Retries in the bucket reuse the key. Cooldowns in the client remain the dedupe. A conflicting 400 is counted, logged without the payload, and not retried.
- Any non-2xx response logs the JSON `error` string (control characters removed, 120 characters, token redacted) at most once per distinct text every few minutes, with a count. The request payload and headers are not logged.
- Enable with `BOB_BRAIN_TOKEN_FILE` (mode 600, 32+ characters, outside this repo) and optional `BOB_BRAIN_URL` (loopback only, default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`). Unset token file means disabled.
- The note is inserted only where the prompt contains `$LONG_MEMORY`. One note defaults to 900 characters and the block defaults to 2500, newest notes first, still under the unverified header. Both caps are env-configurable. See `docs/BOB_BRAIN.md`. The longer caps are merged-pending-deploy, not on the live process.
- Plan jobs send `{objective, footprint:{width,depth}}` with width/depth in 1..32, or 5×5 when the goal text has no size. Scripts can call `enqueuePlan`, `enqueueFailureAnalysis`, `currentAdvice`, and `status`.
- V2 receipts are a separate switch. `BOB_BRAIN_V2_EVENT_LOG` must be an absolute path or Bob writes nothing. Use a different file from the one V2 already tails (`BOBBOT_V2_BRAIN_LOG`); V2 has only that one path today. `lesson_applied` and `lesson_outcome` are not emitted. See `docs/BOB_BRAIN.md`.

## Deploy note for secure-mindserver
- If deployed, the MindServer web UI (port 8081) becomes loopback-only. To keep LAN access set `MINDCRAFT_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` in the service env before restarting.
- BobBot control needs `MINDCRAFT_BOBBOT_TOKEN_FILE` pointing at a private (mode 600, regular file, >= 32 chars) secret kept outside this repo. A bad file makes MindServer refuse to start.

## Known drift (2026-10-23)
- Live `node_modules/mineflayer-pathfinder` was hand-patched beyond live `patches/mineflayer-pathfinder+2.4.5.patch` (door/gate fixes). A fresh `npm ci` from `49761ee`/`5d8be33` would drop those fixes. Branch `newearth/port-minebob-2026-10-23` makes the patch file match live. **Fixed** (PR #1, in `dddbaf4`).
- Live `node_modules/prismarine-chunk/src/pc/1.18/ChunkColumn.js` (prismarine-chunk 1.41.0) was hand-patched on 2026-10-19 (`~/ai-player/patches/prismarine-chunk-26.1-guard.patch` on LinuxGrok): `mcData.version['>=']('26.1')` throws with minecraft-data 3.98.0 (no `26.1` entry), so it is wrapped in try/catch and falls back to `hasFluidCount = false`. `dddbaf4` had no patch file for it, so a fresh `npm ci` would drop the guard and likely break chunk loading. **Fixed** on branch `newearth/prismarine-chunk-guard-2026-10-23` by `patches/prismarine-chunk+1.41.0.patch` (merged to `newearth/main` as PR #3, `b940ba3`); with it, a clean `npm ci` of this fork gives a `node_modules` identical to live (`diff -rq` empty).
- Note: `patches/minecraft-data+3.97.0.patch` is applied to the installed minecraft-data 3.98.0; patch-package warns about the version mismatch but applies it cleanly. Not changed.

## Rules
See `AGENTS.md`: public-repo warning (no secrets, Discord IDs or ops), Randy's rules, never merge/deploy/force-push/change default branches without his authorization.
